# DSA Revision

## Basic Maths
Basic maths section in A-z sheet

## Language specific things
Revise STL
Revise python stuff
Revise javascript dsa features (if applicable)
Do the same things for other languages.

## Arrays
Revise Array questions that you have solved search for most important array questions.
Revise Dynamic programming questions.

## Strings
Revise Common patterns, string operations, and language specific things.

## Linked Lists
Revise basic questions like deleting an element, finding middle element

## Stack
Revise infix,prefix,postfix.
Revise matching parentheses

## Queue & Dequeue
Just solve questions

## Trees
Preorder, postorder, inorder (DFS)
level order (BFS)
standard stuff - depth of tree, height of tree, etc
same for graphs

## Heaps
Implement from scratch as fast as possible - best way to revise this.
Don't forget to heap sort
Revise Priority_queues

## Graphs
Remember to revise adjacency lists and adjacency matrix both
There are a few important patterns

## Dynamic programming
There are 5 important patterns

## Named Algorithms
Start with implementing each named algorithm for every revision session
Slowly you won't need to implement them completely for revision, they will be imprinted on your mind
(This is not that important, understanding their approach is enough)
Important topics
- Binary search
- Path finding algorithms
- Sorting
